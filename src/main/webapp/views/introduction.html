    <h4 class="subtitle">Why IE8 compatibility?</h4>
    <div>
        From version 1.3 on, AngularJS is dropping support for IE8. AngularJS 1.2 will continue to support IE8, but
        the core team does not plan to spend time addressing issues specific to IE8 or earlier. However, IE8 is still
        used on some occasions. In my case, IE8 is the major browser used by my clients, and it won't be changed for
        additional one year or two. It brought me great headache when I try to resolve IE8 compatibility issues one
        by one. So I thought it would be helpful to contribute what I've learned as I go.

    <h4 class="subtitle">What should I start with?</h4>
    <div>
        It is worth spending a little while on the official AngularJs site:
        <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie" target="_blank">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie</a>.

    <h4 class="subtitle">Recommendation</h4>
    <div>
        IE8 does not support a key set of functions that are heavily used by AngularJS, AngularJS UI for Bootstrap,
        etc. As a result, web page error will be poped up whenever your code used something that replies on those
        functions. You don't have to re-invent the wheels since some smart head has already compiled those functions
        and made them public available. I highly recommend you download those pieces of code and conditionally refer
        those in your code. Please check the code out at: <a

    <h4 class="subtitle">Testing environment</h4>
    <div>
        I used IE8, AngularJS 1.2.6, and Angular ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.11.2 specifically for all tests. I don't test with
        IE8above;the solutions to IE8 may or may not fit other IE versions.
